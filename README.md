# SimFrame
*Improving accelerators through consistent, complete, and easy to use simulations.*

## Mission
SimFrame is a framework for performing simulations of particle accelerators (particularly linac-based FELs) that aims to be simple to use, and complete.

Our mission statement is *"To create a start to end framework for consistent, transparent simulations of particle accelerators and FELs that anybody can use, and that everybody trusts."*
